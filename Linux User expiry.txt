A developer Jim has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. Being a temporary resource for this project we need a temporary user for Jim. Its a good idea to create a user with some auto expiry date so that user won't be able to access servers once expired.


So create a user named jim on the App server 2. Set expiry date to 2021-03-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.



    1  sudo adduser jim
    2  sudo chage -E 2021-03-28 jim     --TO ADD EXPIRY DATE TO LINUX USER 
    3  sudo chage -l jim                --TO SEE ALL INFORMATION FOR LINUX USER 

NOTE:
====
1) (chage -d 2018-02-11 ravi)
    --To set the date or number of days when the password was last changed, use the -d flag as follows
2)  (chage -W 10 ravi)
    --Then, the -W option allows you to set the number of days of warning before a password change is required. Considering the command below, the user ravi will be warned 10 days prior to his password expiring.
3)  (man chage)
    --MANUAL
