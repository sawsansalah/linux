Troubleshoot and fix the issue, and make sure haproxy service is running on Nautilus LBR server.

    1  systemctl start haproxy
    2  systemctl enable haproxy
    3  systemctl status haproxy -l
    4  cd /etc/haproxy/
    5  haproxy -c -f haproxy.cfg       --(timeouts are set to a non-zero value: 'client', 'connect', 'server'.)
    6  vi haproxy.cfg
       	timeout connect  5000
        timeout client  10000
        timeout server  10000
              
               (or)

        timeout connect 5000ms
        timeout client 50000ms
        timeout server 50000ms

       REMOVE # BEFORE backend app
    7  systemctl restart haproxy
    8  systemctl status haproxy -l

2.2. Time format
----------------

Some parameters involve values representing time, such as timeouts. These
values are generally expressed in milliseconds (unless explicitly stated
otherwise) but may be expressed in any other unit by suffixing the unit to the
numeric value. It is important to consider this because it will not be repeated
for every keyword. Supported units are :

  - us : microseconds. 1 microsecond = 1/1000000 second
  - ms : milliseconds. 1 millisecond = 1/1000 second. This is the default.
  - s  : seconds. 1s = 1000ms
  - m  : minutes. 1m = 60s = 60000ms
  - h  : hours.   1h = 60m = 3600s = 3600000ms
  - d  : days.    1d = 24h = 1440m = 86400s = 86400000ms
