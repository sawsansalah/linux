On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes which is degrading the performance of server. So we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:


a. soft limit = 70

b. hard_limit = 97



    1  cat /etc/passwd
    2  sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf
       nfsuser      soft    nproc   70
       nfsuser      hard    nproc   97


Note
====
TO CHECK LIMITS     1)  ulimit -Sn
                    2)  ulimit -Hn
