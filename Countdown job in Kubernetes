The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to create few jobs in Kubernetes cluster. They might come up with some real scripts/commands to use, but for now they are preparing the templates and testing the jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:


Create a job countdown-devops.

The spec template should be named as countdown-devops (under metadata), and the container should be named as container-countdown-devops

Use image centos with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e centos:latest, and restart policy should be Never.

Use command for i in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one ; do echo $i ; done

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.




sudo vi countdown-devops.yml

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: countdown-devops
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: countdown-devops

         - "-c"
         - "for i in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one ; do echo $i ; done"
      restartPolicy: Never
