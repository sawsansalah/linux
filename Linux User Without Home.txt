The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except for App 3 in Stratos Datacenter.


Create a user named jim in App Server 3 without a home directory.


    1  useradd -M jim               --WITH THIS COMMAND USER DIRECTORY WILL NOT BE CREATE WITH -M
    2  cat /etc/passwd
    3  cd /home/
