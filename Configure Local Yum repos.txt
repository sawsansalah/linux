Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending item from last month so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

b. Create a yum repo named yum_local and make sure to set Repository ID to yum_local. Configure it to use packages location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package wget from this newly created repo.

    1  cd /packages/downloaded_rpms/
    2  ls
    3  cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
    4  ls
    5  yum install wget  - we get error here
